# Patents

Patents I've been a part of (ie, co-author). These are all from my time at Invoca. These were all team efforts and we really had a great team for innovation.
I'm particularly proud of "Pitman-Yor Process Topic Modeling Pre-Seeded by Keyword Grouping" as that's one where I was working from my kitchen table, called Mike (my co-author on it) up and said "Hey man, can we do this with our topic modeling tech?" and we hashed most of it out over the next few hours. Good times...

# Patents

Patents I've been a part of (ie, co-author). These are all from my time at Invoca.
I'm particularly proud of "Pitman-Yor Process Topic Modeling Pre-Seeded by Keyword Grouping" as that's one where I called Mike (my co-author on it) up and said "Hey man, can we do this with our topic modeling tech?" and we hashed most of it out over the next few hours.
